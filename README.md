# OpenMpipi_for_IDRs

This repository contains Python scripts for OpenMpipi implementation for intrinsically disordered proteins simulating biomolecular condensates with the residue-resolution coarse-grained force field (OpenMpipi). The scripts are designed for GPU-accelerated, direct-coexistence simulations of charge-rich, intrinsically disordered proteins (e.g., hnRNPA1-LCD, DDX4-NTD), along with post-processing tools for phase diagrams, critical temperatures, density profiles, and performance benchmarking.
